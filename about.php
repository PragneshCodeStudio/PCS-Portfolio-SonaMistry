                                                    "Mehendi is more than just an ornamental art—it is a
                                                    sacred expression of purity, joy, and blessings.
                                                    When I started my career eight years ago, it was
                                                    mostly associated with bridal rituals. But today,
                                                    people embrace it for festivals, personal
                                                    milestones, and even as a token of good fortune for
                                                    new ventures."</em>

                                                With time, Mehendi has evolved from intricate
                                                traditional motifs to contemporary figurative
                                                masterpieces, reflecting the essence of changing times
                                                while staying true to its cultural roots.

                                                <em>"Every stroke, every swirl, and every intricate
                                                    motif is a result of dedication and patience.
                                                    Mehendi artists spend long hours in precision, often

                                                    to life. The art deserves as much appreciation as
                                                    any other wedding craft."</em>

                                                Mehndi is not just an art-it is a language of
                                                tradition, love and personal expression. And if there
                                                is one artist who has mastered this language, it is

                                                bridal mehndi, Sona's journey began almost eight years
                                                ago, rooted in her Marwari heritage and inspired by
                                                the craftsmanship of her father, who is a renowned
                                                name in the furniture industry. What started as a
                                                hobby soon turned into a profession, and today, she is
                                                one of the most sought-after mehndi artists in India.

                                                rather than a hurried ritual.

                                                their pets. Mehndi has become more than just a

                                                special achievements of my career was working with
                                                designer Karan Torani for a campaign shoot where I
                                                created a henna style bindi for
                                                <strong>Tamannaah Bhatia</strong>. It was a challenge
                                                as I had never designed a bindi before but the result
                                                was amazing. I also had the honour of applying alta on
                                                her hands which added a beautiful traditional touch.

                                                Another unforgettable experience was applying mehendi
                                                for influencer Sakshi Sindhwani's wedding and actor
                                                Malhar Thakkar's wedding. Being a part of such
                                                important moments in their lives makes these projects
                                                even more special.

                                                What advice would you give to brides when selecting
                                                their Mehendi designs and planning their Mehendi day?
                                            </h3>
                                            <p>
                                                First and foremost, dedicate a full day to the mehndi.
                                                Many brides underestimate how time-consuming and
                                                detailed the process is. A full bridal mehndi can take
                                                anywhere from four to six hours! If you combine it
                                                with another function, you will be exhausted and won’t
                                                be able to fully enjoy the experience.

                                            <p>
                                                Also, keep the mehndi ceremony private. Avoid large,
                                                chaotic gatherings where guests constantly interrupt
                                                or take pictures while the mehndi is being applied.
                                                Instead, take it as a time to relax and connect with
                                                your loved ones. This will make the experience much
                                                more enjoyable and memorable.

                                                My mehndi is never just a design—it’s an experience. I
                                                specialize in spontaneous customization, which means I
                                                don’t follow a pre-made template. I create each design
                                                in the moment, based on the bride’s story and
                                                personality. My intricate little designs, like veiled
                                                brides and small motifs, are loved by brides.

                                                What sets my mehndi apart is balance. While I ensure
                                                intricate details, I keep the design elegant and
                                                girly—never overwhelming. This balance is what makes
                                                my work unique.
